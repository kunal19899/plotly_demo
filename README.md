To start working on this project you will need a clean environment to add and delete your own libraries. The files has a <i>requirements.txt</i> file which will contain all the up-to-date libraries being used. make sure you have python install on your machine before proceeding. <b>This setup procedure should only be used if changes are being made on the a machine outside of any of the ITLab servers.</b>

    1. pip install virtualenv
    2. virtualenv myenv <i>(myenv is the name I chose, any name can be given for the environment)</i>. myenv must be installed in the root directory of this project.
2. ### Activating virtual environment
    <b>If on a MAC/Linux:</b>

    source myenv/bin/activate 

    <b>If using Windows:</b>

    \myenv\Scripts\activate.bat

    <b>Note:</b> these paths will only work if you and the myenv directory are currently in the root directory.

Once you complete these steps your environment will be ready to run the most recent updates made to the dashboard by the ITLab visualization team.
